# Performance bar

plushie-gleam is meant to feel lightweight in use and lightweight
in the process listing. That is a baseline expectation, not an
optimization target chased after the fact.

The runtime sits between every event and every render. Work it
does on a hot path is paid by every interaction in every app.
Idle apps that draw CPU draw battery; runtimes that walk the
tree six times per update are felt on larger trees even when
each walk profiles cleanly. The whole point of going native
through a typed wire is that the host should feel lighter than
what it replaces; a runtime that pegs CPU loses that on its own
merits.

## Working principle

Lightweight is achieved by not doing unnecessary work in the
first place. Optimizing a hot path after the fact is sometimes
necessary; far more of the win comes from never letting the
work appear.

Each piece of work has a cost. Individually most of them are
cheap; the cost compounds across a frame, an interaction, an
app's lifetime, the user's battery. A tree walk that runs in
0.3ms looks fine in isolation; six of them per update on a
medium tree is visible latency. Watch the compounding, not just
the individual microbenchmark.

The canonical example to keep in mind: the `NormalizeCtx` that
threads through `tree.normalize` accumulating widget registry
entries, window IDs, and scope chain in a single traversal,
instead of multiple post-hoc walks. None of the alternative
walks would have flagged as a hotspot in a profile of a small
app. The consolidation was correct work because the redundant
work was unnecessary, the change made the code clearer rather
than worse, and the aggregate cost mattered for larger apps and
edge cases. That is the shape of performance work that earns
its place without a benchmark.

## Readability is the bound

Optimizations that obscure intent trade a forever cost (every
future reader) against a one-time benefit. Decline that trade
by default.

Worth doing without a benchmark because the win is obvious in
shape and readability is preserved or improved:

- Consolidating redundant traversals, dispatches, or
  serialization passes.
- Picking the right data structure for a known access pattern
  (`Dict` over list-scan; `Set` for membership tests; `BitArray`
  for wire bytes).
- Encoding prop values inside `widget/*.build()` once instead of
  re-encoding in normalize or protocol-encode (this is also the
  invariant; see CLAUDE.md notes on the encoding boundary).
- Avoiding a clearly unnecessary allocation, copy, or `list`
  pass that another function on the same data already did.
- Localized refactors where the optimized form is also the
  cleaner form.
- Removing per-frame work that does not depend on per-frame
  inputs (move it to startup, to subscription diff, or to the
  edge where the input changes).

Need a benchmark, profile, or repro before they land, because
the readability cost is real:

- Clever encoding, lookup, or layout schemes that change how
  the code reads.
- Big-O claims of the form "this is O(n) on a hot path" without
  realistic N. Many such claims have N in the dozens, where the
  constant factor of `dict.get` is worse than a linear `list.find`.
- Optimizations on idle or rarely-hit paths (startup, settings
  parsing, error paths, dev-mode overlays).
- Anything that asks the reader to look up a comment to
  understand what the code is doing.
- FFI-based shortcuts where pure Gleam is fast enough.

Measurement is a tiebreaker for the second list, not a gate on
the first.

## What lightweight looks like

Numeric direction for the realistic application profile (a few
hundred to about a thousand active tree nodes, dozens of images,
one to five fonts):

- **Frame budget.** 16.67ms (60fps) for a single update cycle
  end-to-end (event arrival, app `update`, `view`, tree diff,
  wire emit). Most of that budget belongs to the renderer; the
  SDK side should be a small slice.
- **Event-to-update.** Visible by the next frame. Sub-
  millisecond wire round-trip on a local pipe (BEAM); same
  order of magnitude through the WASM transport on JS.
- **Idle CPU.** When nothing is happening, the runtime does no
  measurable work. No periodic polling, no animation tick when
  no animation is active, no spinning subscription threads, no
  recurring `setInterval` on JS, no per-frame walks when the
  tree has not changed.
- **Subscription cost.** Subscribing to a high-frequency source
  is the user's choice; the runtime applies coalescing
  (`default_event_rate`, per-subscription `max_rate`) so the
  cost is bounded by what the user opts into.
- **Resident memory (BEAM).** A few tens of MiB for an idle
  small app process tree. Memory grows with widget state and
  tree size, not with runtime bookkeeping. Internal caches
  (memo, widget view cache, normalize caches) bound their size.

These are direction, not contracts. There is no benchmark
infrastructure in the repo today; numbers should be tightened
or relaxed when measurement disagrees.

## Compile-time work is not free either

Gleam's compiler does substantial work. Adding generic builder
patterns, deeply nested types, or large unions costs
compilation seconds across every project that depends on
plushie. Adding type-level structure is welcome when it catches
a real class of bugs; adding it because "we could express this
in the type system" without a real class of bugs is the same
kind of compounding cost the runtime side worries about. See
`dsl-discipline.md`.

## Tree diff is the load-bearing piece

`plushie/tree.diff` is the hot path that runs every cycle the
view tree changes. Worth preserving:

- Single-pass diff producing minimal `PatchOp` lists.
- Memo-based skipping (`MemoCache`) for expensive subtrees
  with stable cache keys; restored entries also restore
  registry and window-ID accumulators so the second-pass walk
  stays gone.
- Per-widget view cache so deferred composite widgets do not
  re-render when neither props nor state changed.
- Patch paths as `List(Int)` (child indices), not string IDs;
  the renderer consumes integer arrays.

Changes to the diff path that look like cleanups but actually
inflate work per node (extra `dict.get` chains, redundant
`PropValue` rebuilding, repeated `string.contains` calls where
a destructure would do) get caught here because the
compounding is most visible.
